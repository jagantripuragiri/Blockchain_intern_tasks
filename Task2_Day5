## üìù Short Report

The three blockchain platforms serve different needs based on their architecture and features. **Ethereum**, being a public blockchain, offers open access and strong decentralization, ideal for trustless environments. It supports smart contracts primarily written in Solidity and has a native token (Ether). However, it has relatively low throughput and scalability challenges compared to private alternatives.

**Hyperledger Fabric**, a private blockchain, provides high throughput, flexible consensus, and a modular architecture. Its permissioned model makes it suitable for enterprise use where participants are known. It supports smart contracts in multiple programming languages and offers privacy through private channels‚Äîmaking it ideal for complex supply chains.

**R3 Corda**, though originally private, operates well in a consortium setting. It emphasizes privacy, scalability, and legal contract representation. With point-to-point data sharing and no global broadcast, it is optimized for use in financial sectors like interbank settlements.

### ‚úÖ Platform Recommendations:

- **Decentralized app**: `Ethereum` ‚Äì for its open access and smart contract ecosystem.
- **Supply chain network among known partners**: `Hyperledger Fabric` ‚Äì for high throughput, privacy, and modularity.
- **Inter-bank financial application**: `R3 Corda` ‚Äì for strong privacy, regulatory alignment, and financial contract support.
